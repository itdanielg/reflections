What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
--Initializing a repository starts tracking all the files in it. You need to do it to start using Git to track changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
--The staging area is different from the working directory because it contains changes you want to commit next, and, unlike the repository the changes aren't committed.
--The staging area's value is to give you a place to group together the changes you would like to make into your next commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
--By adding all related files for that logical change to staging together.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
--When trying to add a specific feature, you could add it to a branch so that it had it's own history, and you could reverse the merge later if you needed to.
