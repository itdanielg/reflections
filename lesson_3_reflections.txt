When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--When you want to work with other people in the same code base.
--When you just want your work to be backed up in case anything happens to your computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--So that you can pull changes when you are ready to combine the remote changes into yours.
