When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
--When you want to work with other people in the same code base.
--When you just want your work to be backed up in case anything happens to your computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--So that you can pull changes when you are ready to combine the remote changes into yours.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
--A fork is basically a copy in the same repository.  A clone is a copy of another respository.  A branch is a label of a string of commits.
--Use a fork on GitHub, etc, to make a copy of a repository and do your own modifications. Clone to create a branch locally to track remote.
--A branch to try out changes, features, fixes, etc branched off the main branch so that you can work on them separately from other changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
--The benefit is in case something happens to the remote branch, you still have a local copy.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
--Without Git, you could use something like SVN to checkout files for changes, but that slows things down unless you're never working in the same file.
